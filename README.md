# mmul_systolic_array
Verilog implementation of a weight stationary systolic array for matrix multiplication, with skew/deskew data orchestration and AXI4-stream integration

## Overview
This project is a Verilog implementation of a 4x4 Weight-Stationary Systolic Array designed for matrix multiplication. The design targets the SkyWater 130nm technology node using the OpenLane physical design flow. It features AXI4-Stream interfaces for integration with larger system-on-chip (SoC) architectures.
